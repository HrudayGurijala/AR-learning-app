# AR Music Application

## Project Overview
This project is an Augmented Reality (AR) learning application built using A-Frame and AR.js. Users can interact with virtual instruments by scanning specific AR markers, which trigger a 3d object to hover and paly animations.
In this version(v.1.0) , I have done the markers implementation only. Further development can be done by developing an interface and adding more features like upload custom model and view.

## Technologies Used
- **A-Frame**: A web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences.
- **AR.js**: A JavaScript library for augmented reality in web browsers.

## Features
- **AR Markers**: The application uses AR markers to display images of musical instruments (drums, guitar, microphone, piano) in an augmented reality environment.
- **Marker Detection**: The application detects the presence of markers using a barcode type for identification.

## Assets
- **3D models**:3D models of animals starting with letters A to Z.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HrudayGurijala/AR-learning-app
```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have a local server set up to serve the files (e.g., using `http-server` or similar).
3. **Open in Browser**: Open `index.html` in a web browser that supports WebXR (such as Chrome or Firefox).

## How to Use
- **Scan Markers**: Use a camera-enabled device to scan the AR markers(Available in the markers folder). The corresponding model will appear, and its animations start playing.

## Troubleshooting
- **Marker Not Detected**: Ensure your camera has a clear view of the marker and the lighting conditions are suitable.

## Future works 
- Can integrate a UI to guide and ask for the camera permission.
- Upload personalised models and view using existing 3x3 markers.
